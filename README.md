# Simulation_and_Modeling_Techniques

Projects on the theory, statistical aspects, and implementation of computational methods for stochastic simulation 
and event-driven systems modeling. Topics on those assignments include random sampling, Monte Carlo integration,
variance reduction, Markov methods, queuing theory, discrete-event systems simulation, input/output data analysis,
and simulation based optimization.
